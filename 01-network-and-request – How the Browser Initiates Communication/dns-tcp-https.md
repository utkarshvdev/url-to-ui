# 🌐 1. DNS → TCP → HTTPS – From URL to Connection

When a user types a URL like https://github.com into the browser, several network-level operations occur before the browser even requests the content. This section dives deep into that journey.


### 🧩 Step-by-Step Breakdown:


### 1. DNS Resolution (Domain to IP)

- The browser checks the local cache → OS cache → router cache → ISP DNS cache → authoritative DNS servers.

- A recursive DNS resolver is used to find the actual IP.

- Uses UDP on port 53.

🔧 Tool Tip: Try nslookup github.com or dig github.com to see DNS in action.

```
github.com
   ↓
140.82.121.3 (IP Address)
```


### 2. TCP Handshake (3-Way Connection Setup)

- Occurs on port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS).

- Ensures reliable transmission using:

(i)  SYN → Client initiates

(ii) - SYN-ACK → Server acknowledges

(iii) - ACK → Client confirms

```
Client: SYN ➝
Server:    ⇠ SYN-ACK
Client: ➝ ACK
```

This handshake establishes a socket (connection ID) between client and server.

### 3. TLS Handshake (Secure the Channel)

(i) - Starts with ClientHello: Cipher suites, TLS version, and random number.

(ii) - ServerHello: Chosen cipher, certificate.

(iii) - Certificate is verified using CA (Certificate Authority).

Pre-master secret is exchanged (via RSA or Diffie-Hellman), used to derive session keys.

```
ClientHello → ServerHello
      ↓               ↓
  Certificate     Session Keys
      ↓               ↓
   Encrypted channel is established (HTTPS)
```


🔐 Once secure, HTTP can begin on top of this encrypted TCP connection.

✅ Key Takeaways:

 - DNS translates names to IPs.

 - TCP ensures ordered delivery.

 - TLS protects confidentiality and authenticity.
