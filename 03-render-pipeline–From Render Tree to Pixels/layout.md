# ðŸ“„ Layout â€“ Positioning Elements on the Page

The layout stage computes the **position and size** of each object in the render tree.

## ðŸ§© Steps:
1. Start from the root (e.g., `<html>`, `<body>`)
2. Traverse recursively and calculate dimensions
3. Consider flow, box model, flex/grid rules

## ðŸ“¦ Box Model Influence:
- `margin`, `padding`, `border`, `width`, `height`
- Layout is affected by fonts, images, screen size

## ðŸ“Š Diagram:

## âœ… Key Notes:
- A layout is triggered by DOM/CSSOM changes
- Costly operation (especially on large trees)
- Use `will-change` and `contain` wisely to optimize
