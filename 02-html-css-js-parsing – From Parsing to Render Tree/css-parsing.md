# ðŸŽ¨ CSS Parsing â€“ From Styles to CSSOM

## ðŸ”¸ What is CSS Parsing?

CSS parsing is the process of converting CSS code (external or inline) into a CSS Object Model (CSSOM), which maps rules to elements.

---

## ðŸ§© Steps in CSS Parsing

1. **Tokenization** â€“ Converts styles into tokens (selectors, properties).
2. **Parsing** â€“ Builds the rules tree.
3. **CSSOM** â€“ Maps selectors to style rules.

## ðŸš« Render Blocking

- CSS is render-blocking. The browser will NOT render any content until the CSSOM is complete.
- This is why CSS files should load fast and early.

---

## ðŸ§  Example:

CSS:
```css
body {
  font-size: 16px;
  color: blue;
}
```

CSSOM (Conceptual):
```text
Rule: body
 â”œâ”€ font-size: 16px
 â””â”€ color: blue
```

## âœ… Summary

- CSS is parsed into CSSOM for style computation.
- CSS blocks rendering until fully loaded.
